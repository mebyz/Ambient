## Version 0.3.0-dev (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Added

#### Headline features

- **Client**: The client can now **run on the web**.
- **Deploy**: The `ambient deploy` command can now be used to deploy a project to the Ambient runtime services.
- **Audio**: Spatial audio is now supported for 3D sounds. See the [physics example](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/blob/main/guest/rust/examples/basics/physics/src/client.rs) and [first_person_camera example](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/blob/main/guest/rust/examples/basics/first_person_camera/src/client.rs)
- **Networking**: The networking protocol now supports WebTransport for the web client.

- **Rendering**: Added a `torus` primitive. Thanks to [@mebyz](https://github.com/mebyz) for implementing this in [#376](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/pull/376)!
- **Physics**: Add `set_character_controller_position` to the `physics` API. Thanks to [@devjobe](https://github.com/devjobe) for implementing this in [#398](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/pull/398).
- **ECS**: `Duration` is now a supported primitive type.
- **ECS**: All integer types from 8-bit to 64-bit are now supported as component types, including signed and unsigned variants. Additionally, all signed and unsigned integer vector types are now supported. This includes `U16`, `IVec2`, `UVec3`, etc.
- **Docs**: The IDE documentation has been improved, including information on how to set up Emacs for Ambient development (thanks to [@kevzettler](https://github.com/kevzettler) in [#505](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/pull/505)).

#### Examples

- **Clock**: An analog `clock` example has been added to test line rendering.
- **Audio control**: An `audio_ctrl` example has been added to shwo the new audio API usage with UI.

### Changed

#### Breaking

- **API**: Locally-broadcasted messages can now choose to include the originating module in the broadcast; this is an additional boolean parameter to `ModuleMessage::send_local_broadcast` and `message::Target::LocalBroadcast`.
- **Audio**: Audio API has completely changed to adapt to the ECS style. See the [audio documentation](https://ambientrun.github.io/Ambient/reference/audio.html) for the new usage.
- **Camera**: Renamed `screen_to_world_direction` to `screen_position_to_world_ray` and `clip_space_ray` to `clip_position_to_world_ray`. See [#410](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/issues/410).
- **Physics**: Renamed the `visualizing` component to `visualize_collider`.
- **Animation**: The animation system has been reworked. See the [animation documentation](https://ambientrun.github.io/Ambient/reference/animations.html) for details. Thanks to [@devjobe](https://github.com/devjobe) for laying the foundation for this!
- **Physics**: Renamed `box_collider` to `cube_collider`.
- **API**: The `time` function has been split into `game_time` and `epoch_time`. The `dtime` component has been renamed to `delta_time`. The `frametime` function has been renamed to `delta_time`.
- **Project**: Projects have been renamed to Embers; see the [ember documentation](https://ambientrun.github.io/Ambient/reference/ember.html) for details.
- **Assets**: Asset pipelines now use TOML instead of JSON. Use the `ambient assets migrate-pipelines-toml` command to migrate. (Note that this command will be removed in the next release.)
- **Rendering**: Removing the `outline_recursive` component from a entity will now remove the outline from its children as well.
- **API**: The `ambient_ui` prelude (and the `ambient_api` prelude, by extension) no longer glob-imports components into the global namespace. This means that you will need to import components explicitly.

#### Non-breaking

- **Logging**: The logging output levels have been tweaked to better communicate the state of the system at any given time.
- **Debugger**: The debugger has been improved with a resizable sidebar, a scrollable view, and a component filter.
- **Animation**: The animation graph is now executed on the server as well.

### Fixed

- **Rendering**: Skinned meshes will no longer be corrupted when there is more than one skinned mesh in a mesh buffer.
- **UI**: `TextEditor` will no longer capture input even when it is not visible.
- **Rendering**: Decals now render more consistently.
- **API**: `entity::wait_for_component` will now exit if the entity is despawned.
- **API**: The `message::Source` methods no longer consume the source when returning their data.
- **Rendering**: Lines with a `from` located after a `to` on the X-dimension will now render correctly.
- **API**: The `entity::mutate_component` documentation now refers to the correct parameter. Thanks to [@aldzban](https://github.com/aldzban) for fixing this in [#482](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/pull/482).
- **UI**: The `ScrollArea` now has a scroll bar.
