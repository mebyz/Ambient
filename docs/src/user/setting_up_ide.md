# Setting up your IDE

Our recommended setup is using Visual studio code (VSCode).

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

First, install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Then install the following plugins:
- [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/), as described [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust).
- [CodeLLDB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb). This one is optional, but with it you can launch your project from with VSCode by pressing F5.
